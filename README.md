Java Object-Oriented Programming Voting System uses the concepts of object-oriented programming. I created a safe online voting system in Java to secure vote casting, candidate administration and voter registration and authentication that are supported by the system.  It has procedures in place to avoid duplicate votes and calculate correct election results in order to maintain integrity.  
The project maintains logical organization and robust data protection while emphasizing usability with an intuitive interface.
